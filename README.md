# stern-wheeler
Filament buffer for multi-material FDM 3D printers

Special Note:
I have uploaded the Stern-Wheeler to printables. This github will remain and I will keep it updated. Please consider downloading from printables however, as I do enjoy earning free prusament. :-) The mini and mega sizes will not be available here and will only be available on printables.

Thank you to everyone who gave feedback and helped with development!

Change log:
5/6/2023
- Published these files at printables.com
- Added mini and mega sizes to printables
- Removed assembly instructions and replaced with an exploded view (a picture is worth 1000 words)

5/4/2023
- Removed ridges from wheel and added scallops. Greatly reduces wheel friction.
- Added a notch to the wheel for the print seam. Make sure your slicer takes advantage! Reduces wheel friction.
- Loosened fit of pins slightly to prevent lane cracking during assembly. 
- Reduced thru hole diameter for 5mm fasteners on axel. Positions wheel more accuretly during assembly.
- Rolled back increased clearance between lanes and wheel from 4/7 update. Not needed with new wheel design.

4/7/2023
- Oriented stl's for printing
- Lengthened pins and added matching recesses to clamps, mount, and wheel mount. Should help with wheel alignment during assembly.
- Increased clearance between lanes and wheel by 0.1mm
- Added hex feature to axle that recesses into the wheel mount. Should make assembly easier.
- Removed material from bottom of wheel to make wheel alignment easier
- Made filament path "ambidextrous" so either side can be the inlet or outlet
- Added BOM
- Added written printing and assembly instructions to this readme

BOM
- 2x 608 Bearings
- 12x M3 heatset inserts
- 12x M3x8 or M3x10 cap screws
- 2x M5x16 button head screws
- about 700g of filament (for a 6 lane buffer)

Printing instructions:
- Designed to be printed with ABS. If you mix materials make sure that they have equal amount of shrinkage or your wheel might not fit!
- 2 perimeters, 15% infill for wheel
- 4 perimeters, 40% infill for everything else

Assembly instructions:
1) See exploded view. ;-)
