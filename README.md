Change log:
4/7/2023
- Oriented stl's for printing
- Lengthened pins and added matching recesses to clamps, mount, and wheel mount. Should help with wheel alignment during assembly.
- Increased clearance between lanes and wheel by 0.1mm
- Added hex feature to axle that recesses into the wheel mount. Should make assembly easier.
- Removed material from bottom of wheel to make wheel alignment easier
- Made filament path "ambidextrous" so either side can be the inlet or outlet
- Added BOM
- Added written printing and assembly instructions to this readme

BOM
- 2x 608 Bearings
- 10x M3x8 or M3x10 cap screws
- 2x M5x16 button head screws
- about 700g of filament (for a 6 lane buffer)

Printing instructions:
- Any material should work, but if you mix materials make sure that they have equal amount of shrinkage or your wheel might not fit!
- 2 perimeters, 15% infill for wheel
- 4 perimeters, 40% infill for everything else

Assembly instructions:
1) Install M3 heatset inserts in pins
2) Fasten the axle to the wheel mount with an M5x16 button head screw
3) Install 2x 608 skate bearings into the wheel
4) Place lane #1 on your workbench, hex side up
5) Place the wheel in it's position in the lane. Be sure to orient wheel with the flat side of the divisions facing up.
6) Install the next lane by sliding it down over the top of the wheel. You will need to shimmy the lane down around the wheel dividers. Go slow and don't over stress the plastic.
7) Install remaining lanes the same way
8) Put the spacer in place on top of the upper 608 bearing
8) Place the cover on top and loosely secure to the axel with a M5x16 button head screw 
9) Start driving in the pins. You may need to use gentle taps with a hammer. The fit is tight in order to force all parts (and especially the wheel) into alignment.
10) Once all the pins are in, flip the assembly over and install the wheel mount, clamps, and mounting bracket with M3x8 or M3x10 cap screws. Tightening the fastners should pull the pins through the assembly so that only about 1mm protudes form the other side.
11) Install the remaining clamps on the cover
12) Assembly compelete!
